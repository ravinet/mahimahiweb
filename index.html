        <p>Web pages can be modeled as directed acyclic graphs (dependency
graphs) which capture the relationships between all of the page's objects.
Polaris is a new system that accelerates web page loads by first creating
fine-grained dependency graphs for a page (using Scout), and then exposing
these new graphs to browsers such that they can aggresively fetch objects to
minimize round trips between clients and servers.</p>

        <h2 class="callout">Track fine-grained dependencies with Scout</h2>
        <p>Scout enables developers to automatically track all interactions
between objects on a web page. After rewriting a page to support logging, Scout
generates a list of reads and writes to a pages state (with detailed
information about which script and line number is triggering the read/write).
It then processes this list to produce a list of dependencies between the
objects on a page.</p> </div>

          <h2 class="callout">Faster Page Loads with Polaris</h2>
          <p>Polaris exposes fine-grained dependency graphs (tracked by Scout)
to browsers, along with a JavaScript scheduling library. This library allows
browsers to completely load pages with JavaScript, using Scout's dependency
graphs to fetch objects as aggressively as possible while ensuring
correctness.<p> </div>
      <div class="feature span4">
        <h2 class="callout">Browser Agnostic</h2>
        <p>Polaris is currently implemented at the JavaScript layer, making it
a cross-browser solution. Developers can still create different pages for
different client browsers (e.g., using User-agent headers). In such cases,
Scout graphs must be generated for each page, but Polaris remains
unchanged.</p> </div>

<p>Scout produces fine-grained dependency graphs for web pages by rewriting
pages to load reads and writes to the page's state, and then processing the
generated logs to extract inter-object dependencies. Polaris then exposes these
fine-grained dependency graphs to browsers, along with a JavaScript scheduling
library. Using this library, browsers can aggressively fetch objects in a way
that minimizes round trip times between clients and servers (and thus, reduces
page load times) while ensuring correctness.  </p>

  <p>
Scout first rewrites a page's HTML and JavaScript objects such that, upon
execution, they will output a list of reads and writes to the page's state.
These log entries include details such as the filename and line number that
trigger the read or write, as well as variable names and object id information.
Scout then processes this log to extract dependencies between objects on a
page. Using these dependencies, Scout outputs the fine-grained dependency graph
for the given page.  </p>

    <div class="span8">
<p>
Today's browsers are constrained by uncertainty regarding how objects on a page
interact. As a result, they are forced to use conservative assumptions when
loading pages, to ensure correctness. For example, because browsers today don't
know whether two objects on a page share state (and thus have a dependency
between one another), they are forced to load these objects serially, in the
order that the corresponding HTML tags are in. While this ensure correctness,
it often fails to fully utilize network and CPU resources during page loads,
and thus prevents browsers from loading pages as quickly as possible.
</p>
<p>
Polaris tackles this problem by exposing fine-grained dependency graphs
(generated by Scout) to browsers, along with a JavaScript scheduling library
(the scheduler stub). Executing the scheduler library enables browsers to
completely load pages from JavaScript, in a way that most efficient utilizes
the available resources, and thereby reduces the number of round trips between
clients and servers, and thus, the page load time. To load a page, the
scheduler uses XMLHttpRequests to fetch objects, and functions like
window.eval() to evaluate responses. Importantly, the scheduler dynamically
prioritizes requests that are blocking the largest number of subsequent
requests, based on the fine-grained dependency graph.
